                For over 20 years, Dustin, Denise, Sawyer, and Kenley Smith have put animal well-being firstâ€”raising cattle with care to deliver steaks that exceed expectations.
              </p>
              <p>
                What started with grit and stewardship has grown into a full cattle operation, then a commercial beef business, and eventually Ozark Natural Steak Co.
              </p>
              <p>
                We believe great beef starts with stewardship, low-stress handling, clean feed, and the patience to do it right. Every decision is made with the animals' well-being in mind.
